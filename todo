    - Score calculation method: Allow users to choose between different methods for calculating the work output score, such as a simple sum of skill levels, a weighted average based on work speed, or a custom formula.
    - Score display format: Provide options for displaying the work output score as a raw number, a percentage, or a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).
    - Score update frequency: Let users decide how often the work output score should be updated, such as every in-game day, week, or month.
    - Score decay rate: Allow users to set a decay rate for the work output score, so that it decreases over time if a pawn's work performance declines.
    - Score color-coding: Enable users to customize the color-coding for different score ranges, making it easier to identify high and low performers at a glance.
