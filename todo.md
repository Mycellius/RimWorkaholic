    - Score calculation method: Allow users to choose between different methods for calculating the work output score, such as a simple sum of skill levels, a weighted average based on work speed, or a custom formula.
    - Score display format: Provide options for displaying the work output score as a raw number, a percentage, or a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).
    - Score update frequency: Let users decide how often the work output score should be updated, such as every in-game day, week, or month.
    - Score decay rate: Allow users to set a decay rate for the work output score, so that it decreases over time if a pawn's work performance declines.

- Score color-coding: easier to identify high and low performers at a glance.
- Fix the stat, it currently does not display in the stat window of the pawn, and doesnt update properly in rimhud.
- on first load, ask the user if it wants it to be place on the default spot for default rimhud or place it themselves, default spot to be determined later
